# fptest

An iterator over floating-point numbers which are hard
to convert from/to decimal form.

## Math

Converting a number `x` from/to another base (usually 2 or 10), as done in
`atof` or `ftoa` functions, involves multiplying

    x × bⁿ = digits + ε

where `|ε| < 1/2` and `digits` is the rounded result, used for display.

A conversion is **hard** is ε is very close to ±1/2, meaning that any
lack of precision might make rounding go the wrong side.

Usually `x` itself is expressed in some base B, meaning that the
computation is:

    mantissa × Bᵖ × bⁿ = digits + ε

where `mantissa` and `digits` have fixed predefined precision,
and the exponents `n` and `p` can be computed from each other.

Thus the problem can be expressed as enumerating all fractions
`mantissa / digits`, within the range of fixed precision integers,
which are very close to `Bᵖ × bⁿ` up to some precision.

An easy way to perform this enueration is to walk the Stern-Brocot
tree, which arranges rational numbers in an (unbounded depth) binary
search tree, such that children of a node always have larger denominator
than their parent node.

Manipulating the Stern-Brocot tree is easiest where elements are written
in continued fraction form.

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in Python 3 and Go.

For each pair of interesting exponents, a interval of fractions
around `2ᵖ × 10ⁿ` is computed, such that lower and upper bounds
have numerators and denominators, bounded by a max integer `M`.

This can easily by precomputed as a small table for languages
where arbitrary-precision arithmetic ("big integers") is hard
or inconvenient.

Then the algorithm traverses entirely the tree between these 2 bounds,
stopping at the depth where integers would overflow the bound `M`.
This step can be done using finite precision arithmetic only.

## Use cases

Printing float64 with precision X:

- the mantissa bound is `2^53`
- the digits bound is `10^X`

Parsing a floating-point number with X decimal digits into float64:

- the mantissa bound is `10^X`
- the digits bound is `2^53`

## Performance

The Python script takes about 1 minute to enumerate double-precision
floats (float64) such that formatting in decimal form is hard
even using 96-bit arithmetic (about 1 million values).

It takes less than a second to enumerate the single-precision
(float32) values that are hard to format when using 52-bit arithmetic
(about 280 values).

The Go implementation can enumerate an interval of 1 million rational numbers
in a few milliseconds.
